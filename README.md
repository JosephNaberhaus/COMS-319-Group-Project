## Instructions
To get started first make sure you have `Node.js 10` installed. To do this you can use the command
```
node -v
```
Second you will want to make sure all the node modules for the project are installed. The command to do this is:
```
npm i
```
##### `(If this fails you may need to use sudo)`

At this point you should be ready to run the server. To do this use the command;
```
npm run devstart
```
This will start a server that can be accessed on the default port of `8080`. It will also use nodemon to watch for any changes to files and recompile and restart server when it sees any.
